# Clinical-Skin-Lesion-Diagnosis
## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of dermatoscopic images of skin lesions into seven categories, using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It addresses the critical issue of data imbalance in medical datasets using the "HAM10000" dataset, which contains diverse skin lesion images.

## Key Features
Implementation of a custom CNN model and a VGG-inspired model for medical image analysis.
Addressing class representation gaps in healthcare datasets with an emphasis on reducing class overrepresentation.
Comparative analysis of different CNN architectures to determine the most effective method for skin cancer diagnosis.

## Technologies
Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks
Data Analysis and Visualization
Python, TensorFlow

## Conclusion
The findings from this project have potential implications for dermatologists, enabling early screening and diagnosis of skin cancers, and improving treatment effectiveness.
